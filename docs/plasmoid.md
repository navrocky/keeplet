Plugin id: `io.github.navrocky.keeplet` (the `org.kde.*` namespace is reserved for KDE projects).

## Conventions
- Only modules shipped with Plasma 6 / Qt 6 / Kirigami. No compiled plugins.
- HTTP via `XMLHttpRequest`; JSON in/out. Don't use `Content-Type` charset tricks: Qt appends `;charset=UTF-8`.
- D-Bus via `org.kde.plasma.workspace.dbus` (see [auth.md](auth.md) for its quirks).
- MVVM layering rules are in [architecture.md](architecture.md): `i18n()` only in Views; ViewModels
  report errors as codes; dependencies are injected as `var` properties so tests can fake them.
- ViewModel tests import the `viewmodel/` directory but must not pull in `services/` (they need
  D-Bus / LocalStorage modules that the build image doesn't have).
- Accounts and secrets are global (see [decisions/0002-accounts-and-storage.md](decisions/0002-accounts-and-storage.md));
  `config/main.xml` keeps only per-instance data plus the legacy single-account keys read once by the migration.
  Don't declare legacy keys as `cfg_*` in config pages: the dialog writes every declared `cfg_*` back on Apply.
- Properties are assigned in arbitrary order when an object is created: don't call a method that needs an injected
  dependency from `onXxxChanged` of another property; use `Component.onCompleted`.
- Don't name a property the same as the id you bind it to (`Foo { auth: auth }` is a binding loop).

## Gotchas
- `console.log` goes to journald unless `QT_FORCE_STDERR_LOGGING=1` is set.
- Synchronous `file://` PUT via XHR truncates the file and writes nothing; use async (only relevant for tooling).
- plasmashell caches QML of loaded widgets; restart it after reinstalling (see [development.md](development.md)).
- `Plasma5Support` `executable` DataSource runs shell commands; avoid passing secrets through it (visible in `ps`).
